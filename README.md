ofxLeapTouch
================

ofxLeapTouch is an [openFrameworks](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks) addon to use the [Leap Motion](https://leapmotion.com) as a Touchless-Touch controller. After setting up a mid-air "touch" sensitive area near your screen, ofxLeapTouch is interpreting interactions in this field like an touch pad and sends basic openFrameworks touch events accordingly. Because of using these [core events](http://openframeworks.cc/documentation/events/ofCoreEvents.html) combining it with touch reactive user interfaces should be straight forward. 

Touchless-Touch is NOT the next step/level for interacting with systems (mainly because of the missing haptical feedback) but it has its advantages (like hover/subtle states) and ofxLeapTouch helps exploring ideas in this field more quickly.
